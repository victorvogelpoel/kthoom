# Introduction #

Since we now have capable byte and bit streams and some working example of decompression in JS it should be possible to expand into other ebook formats.  Wikipedia has a decent overview of [some popular formats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_e-book_formats).

# Details #

There are three other comic book archive formats listed on Wikipedia:

  * .cbt ([TAR format](http://www.mkssoftware.com/docs/man4/tar.4.asp), TODO: find a better link)
  * .cb7 ([7z archive](http://www.7-zip.org/7z.html) TODO: find a better link)
  * .cba (ACE format, probably not worth it)

TODO: Research other eBook formats to see what's most popular and feasible.
